    <p>Tokyo, formerly known as Edo, is the capital city of Japan and the most populated city in the world with 37.468 million people living in it. The former city of Edo<br>
        spans for 13,452 square kilometers throughout the Tokyo Bay. It is situated in the <em>Kantō</em> region, on the central-eastern coast of <em>Honshu</em>, the largest island of the Japanese<br>
        archipelago.
    </p>
    <p>The name Tokyo (東京都) means 'Eastern Capital', and it is formed by the <em>Kanjis</em> 東 (east), 京 (capital) and 都 (metropilis).</p>
    <p>Edo was a well known fishing village, and gained important political standing during the Tokugawa shogunate. During the Meiji Restoration the imperial capital was moved from Kyoto<br>
        to Edo and renamed as Tokyo. The city was devastated in two occasions, first by the Great <em>Kantō</em> earthquake, and during the Second World War by the Allies, although that hasn't<br>
        stopped it from becoming one of the most important financial centres of the modern world.
