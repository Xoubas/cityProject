                The history of Tokyo began not too long ago, that's because until around 400 years ago, the official capital of Japan was still Kyoto, Tokyo was still a populous<br>
                fishing village in the east named <strong>Edo</strong>. Then, when in 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu, the current shogun decided to stablish the <strong>Tokugawa Shogunate</strong> in <strong>Edo</strong>, marking the begining<br>
                of the <strong>Edo</strong> period. The <strong>Edo</strong> period would bring 250 years of stability to Japan until 1868, when the <strong>Meiji Restoration</strong> and the Boshin War started, bringing back the<br>
                imperial system and putting an end to the shogunate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When the <strong>Tokugawa Shogunate</strong> was overthrown, the imperial capital became <strong>Edo</strong>, and its name was officially changed to Tokyo. During the Meiji era (1868-1912), Japan embraced<br>
                a large modernization process, with a huge influence from Western culture. The introduction of many foreign technologies into Japan, allowed for a fast modernization and economic<br>
                growth of the region. The outlawing of some traditional practices was implemented among society, some good, like the revokal of the <em>burakumin</em><br>status during the <strong>Blood tax riots;</strong> and some not so admirable, like the forceful cutting of the <em>chonmage</em> hairstyle, seen a symbol of pride and honor by many.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the Meiji era came the <strong>Taisho era,</strong> mostly known for the improvements of educational standards and the increasing numbre of women who decided to get higher<br>
                level education. In 1923 Tokyo was struck by the <strong>Great Kanto Earthquake</strong>, that devastated around 300.000 homes and affected 140.000 people.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 1926 to 1989 the Showa era took place. Many important events occurred during this period, possibly the most well known might be <strong>World War II.</strong> Although a lot of technological<br>
                advances were made too. In 1927 the first subway line was inaugurated beteween Ueno and Asakusa, universal male suffrage was approved, Tokyo Airport was opened in 1931... And all<br>
                this before the begining of WW2. However, the Second World War took a heavy toll on Japan and the city of Tokyo was devastated during the 1945 bombings.<br>

                After the events of the war, Japan started an extensive recovery plan to overcome the difficult situation of the country. After Japan joined the United Nations in 1956, a great of<br>
                great economic growth started in the country leading to the 1964 Tokyo Olimpics, the inauguration of the <strong>Bullet Train,</strong> and many other achievements to come.
