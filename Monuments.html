        <h1>Tokyo's monuments</h1>

        <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, and the most populated city in the world. It is filled with breathtaking highscrapers and the latest advances in technology,<br>
            but also has a more traditional side to it, which can be reflected by it's shintoist shrines and temples. 
        </p>
        <p>Although Tokyo is a large metropolis with around 40 million people living in it, and it's usually related to narrow streets crowded with people, while being<br>
            flooded by neon lights, it also has a great deal of beatiful parks, that definetily stand out in one of the busiest's cities in the world.

            <h2>3. Hachiko Memorial Statue:</h2>

            <p>Hachiko was a real dog who used to wait for his owner to return from work every day in front of Shibuya Railway Station.</p>
            <p>Because of his dedication to his owner an statue was erected in its honour in 1934, becoming a famous landmark of the city. Every march there's a special ceremony held to<br>
                honour the faithful dog.
            </p>
            <p>Hachiko and his owner are buried together in the Aoyama Cemetery, where he will keep accompanying his owner forever.</p>
