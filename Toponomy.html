            Tokyo, formerly known as <strong>Edo</strong>, is the capital city of Japan and the most populated city in the world with 37.468 million people living in it. The former city of <strong>Edo</strong><br>
            spans for 13,452 square kilometers throughout the Tokyo Bay. It is situated in the <strong><em>Kantō</em> region,</strong> on the central-eastern coast of <strong><em>Honshu</em>,</strong> the largest island of the Japanese<br>
            archipelago.

            The name Tokyo (東京都) means 'Eastern Capital', and it is formed by the <em>Kanjis</em> 東 (east), 京 (capital) and 都 (metropilis).

            <strong>Edo</strong> was a well known fishing village, and gained important political standing during the Tokugawa shogunate. During the Meiji Restoration the imperial capital was moved from Kyoto<br>
            to <strong>Edo</strong> and renamed as Tokyo. The city was devastated in two occasions, first by the <strong>Great <em>Kantō</em> earthquake,</strong> and during the Second World War by the Allies, although that hasn't<br>
            stopped it from becoming one of the most important financial centres of the modern world.
